*client hits key
*event is created
    (:name => :move, :upmove => 0, :rightmove => 0, :timestamp => 111)

*event is sent to server
*client requests new events from server
*server sends array of events
client applies each event if the timestamp is greater than last updated
cient updates last updated timestamp


PlayingState and SceneController need to be changed to send their events
Any events need to be stripped out of models eg shooting
